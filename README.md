Students can upload their photography assignments on the given section. They can give additional informations about the pictures, like their camera settings, date of picture taken, and title.

Teachers can monitor their students using Klifomaya. Teachers can track attendance, their personal informations, and their assignments through teacher's dashboard.

As for their database system, we used Firebase. It is a JSON-based data structure, which is simple and robust to use. Since the purpose of Klifomaya is to track attendance and assignments, we only need a simple data structure that can store personal informations, attendance and student's upload. Hence, we picked Firebase.
